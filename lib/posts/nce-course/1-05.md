### How are you today?

这是朋友或相识的人之间见面时问对方身体状况的寒暄话，一般回答语：

- Fine,thank you.
- I'm fine,thank you.
- I'm very well, thank you.

如问及对方的先生或太太的情况，可以说 How is Tony? 或 How's Emma? 等。相应的回答可以是 He's fine,thanks 或 She's very well,thank you 等。

### And you?

是 And how are you？的简略说法。在回答对方问候健康的话之后反问时用。

### Nice to see you.

是 It's nice to see you. 的简略说法。

这一句也是见面时的客气话，一般回答是：Nice to see you, too. 也可以说：Nice to meet you.
