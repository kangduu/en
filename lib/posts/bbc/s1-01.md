**First, bring the sauce to the boil.**

**Bring to.**

If you bring something to the boil, then you heat it up until it bubbles.

Remember to put the direct object before **to**.

**Now, mix in some herbs.**

Using a spoon to combine the herbs with the sauce is called **mixing in**.

**Then set aside to cool down.**

Two verbs here.

**Set Aside** means 'to move something away from where you are working and leave it alone'.

If you **cool** something **down**, its temperature reduces.

These last three are phrasal verbs.

You can either put the direct object in the middle of the verb or at the end.

So you can **bring** things **to** the boil in a pan, **mix** them **in** with a spoon and **set** them **aside** by a window to **cool down**.
